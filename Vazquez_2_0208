An object with an abstract background.

I plan to use a circle, triangle, square, oval and arc, with varying colors.

For loops would be used to make the background, and repeat a shape to 
make it abstract.

Just like the background random would be impremented into the color of 
the shape so that colors are different and pop out, maybe different 
nuances of a color; making it a theme.

An if statement could be used in the code to prevent the background from 
interfering from appearing above the main focus of the object.
