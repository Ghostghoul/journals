I plan to create an abstract background or a gradient background which 
will have a design in the middle, most likely minimalistic to have a 
contrast between the eccentric and simple aspects of art. I will use 
methods to add color to the shapes and create the random effect of 
colors/shapes in the background to encaspulate the abstract side of it.
