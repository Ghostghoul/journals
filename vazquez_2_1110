I learned that variables are a scalar quantity withing the code, it is used 
to set value to strings of program which need an indicated amount to be 
precise. Loops in coding were used to reproduce the line of code infinitely, 
I used it to repeat the same executed start screen. I used "for" statement
to operate the collection of pins declaring the variable 'int" in the parethe-
sis adding the initializer and the test with either an increment or decrement.

The prototyping process requires a lot attention to detail of the working
 project, due to varying amount of troubleshooting required at points. Along
with the prototype comes the transition of image to PCB this creates problems
when not enough information is giving in the connecting the components, or 
there lack of knowledge of how the components attribute to their specific 
location.(lack of background research)
