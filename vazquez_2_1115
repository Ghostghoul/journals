The 3 types of programmers we talked about were movers, tinkerers, and 
stoppers. The most successful were the tinkerers due to the continued effort 
to improve their work as well as others. Movers are sucessful but don't learn
as much about their work since they do not do enough to improve their final 
project. Stoppers are the least successful  as they stop when a hard task is 
laid upon them, this leads to no improvement or work being done.

Hands on coding is a more effective way of learning because it allows the 
student to have something physical in front of them, so that it can be used 
as a base when coding on a language.
