The static in the code snippet allows us to call the method against the 
class.
 
The angular brackets makes an ArrayList of BadBlocks, we do this to 
specify what class the list contains.

We use an ArrayList to make it easier on us, so that instead of making 
methods repetitively, we create one list that has all the blocks we 
desire.

The for loop checks if i equals 0 and is less than the canvas height, 
setting boundaries.

With the boundary set the i then makes 35 blocks on the canvas within 
the boundaries.

For loop adds a(n) badblock b, declaring it to be the same as badblockz.

While the root is to recall the local getChildren and then add second 
set of badblocks. The root makes the blocks visible in the executable window.

The badblock class was created to name the enemy/rectangle, while 
setting other possible movements to the class.

extends tells the java class that it has the same properties as the 
rectangle class.

The booleans movedown is used to make the block movedown once the 
program starts, it then bounces back because there is a boundary and is 
not moving down.

The getter and setters are public and private, we could add a getter and 
setter in which a block can check if it collides with another blocks, 
thus not allowing it go through the block; with ifCollisionDetected.

We add the getters and setters to create encapsulation through setting a 
method and then getting it later on in the code making it easier to 
create multiple alterations to a program.
