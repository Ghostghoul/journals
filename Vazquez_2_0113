We use arrays in the java to create traps and the hero in the game. The 
traps are meant to be obstacles in the hero's way to create a challenge. 
Using the for loop, we put in the parentheses the coordinates parameters 


(int i = 0; i< 7; i++){ minefield[i] = new trap (randy.nextInt(10), 
randy.nextInt(10));


Using the array of traps and our Hero class array we are able to depict the 
traps and character on screen.
