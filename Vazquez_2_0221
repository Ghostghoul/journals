To add an object to an ArrayLists, you import a java list, then declare 
your object as a public class and write the object under the main.

To loop through elements you use if statements, which are used to check 
for boundaries with integers and booleans.

We extend in java due to the usefulness of methods in a class to another 
class. We do this by adding "extend", helps reduce the amount of code 
that we would need to rewrite.

My game will be made up of a main block attempting to traverse a course 
with enemies in its path. possibly a frogger sort of scenario; subject 
to change.
