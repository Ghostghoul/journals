Abstraction is the use of different code to create new code. For example 
we created walls, treasure, and projectile. For the walls we created a 
class that moved randomly and blocked the player; using the code of 
minefield. for treasure we created a similiar minefield with the 
exception that it gives you something, for my treasure I made it give 
you an extra heart. And for Projectiles you create a method similiar to 
check for trap.
