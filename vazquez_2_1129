object oriented programming is when we define the data type of a data
structure and the operations taht are applied to the data structure. The 
object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. We 
use objects as fundamental building blocks of applications with the status 
object, cost object, and client object. 3 advantages of using object oriented 
programming are that is easy to build, maintain, and upgrade and application.
