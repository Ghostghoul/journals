 An object is an instation of a class, for example could be you as a person.
A variable is a reference to an object or a primitive like an int.

A class refers to the written piece of static code which is used to define it
 the code does not change when executed. While the object is the instance of 
a class, objects are created and eventually destroyed, and while the objects
are still working the properties are changed signficantly.

To instatiate an object is the same as instantiating a class.

public class {
    public int x = 0;
    public int y = 0;
public () { 
    x = a;
    y = b;
  }
}
