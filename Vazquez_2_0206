A java class has properties and behaviors defined by its own class. 
Within the class, fields and methods are used to describe the actions of 
the object.

A javafx class includes a class that extends application, this overruns 
methods that execute specific code.

init() would be a method to start, as well as stop() or start(), as well 
as getparameters().
