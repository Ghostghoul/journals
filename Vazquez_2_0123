The game has static Trap [] minefield before main because it can be 
accessed by the rest of code, if not before main then the classes that 
pull traps will come out with errors because the trap is private. I move 
the hero with;

 bucky.move(answer); landscape[bucky.getY()][bucky.getX()] = bucky.getSymbol();
 
Then you program where the character move by inputting the method under 
the hero class.
