I will add batteries when making the project to make it easier when I combine
it with the finished shell of it.
I will attempt to convert it to a more permanent breadboard when I know the code
works.
I didn't spend much time researching so some time was spent on the specifics 
of the code and how I would make it work.
I tweaked the game for it to work different from the original using other
variations of code of the same game to improve the game.
I should have managed time more efficiently to be able to create more time to
work with.
